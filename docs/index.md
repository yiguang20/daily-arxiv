- **Needles in a haystack: using forensic network science to uncover insider trading**
  - Gian Jaeger et al. | [2512.18918v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18918v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Although the automation and digitisation of anti-financial crime investigation has made significant progress in recent years, detecting insider trading remains a unique challenge, partly due to the limited availability of labelled data. To address this challenge, we propose using a data-driven networks approach that flags groups of corporate insiders who report coordinated transactions that are indicative of insider trading. Specifically, we leverage data on 2.9 million trades reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by company insiders (C-suite executives, board members and major shareholders) between 2014 and 2024. Our proposed algorithm constructs weighted edges between insiders based on the temporal similarity of their trades over the 10-year timeframe. Within this network we then uncover trends that indicate insider trading by focusing on central nodes and anomalous subgraphs. To highlight the validity of our approach we evaluate our findings with reference to two null models, generated by running our algorithm on synthetic empirically calibrated and shuffled datasets. The results indicate that our approach can be used to detect pairs or clusters of insiders whose behaviour suggests insider trading and/or market manipulation.</details>

- **Sources and Nonlinearity of High Volume Return Premium: An Empirical Study on the Differential Effects of Investor Identity versus Trading Intensity (2020-2024)**
  - Sungwoo Kang | [2512.14134v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14134v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Chae and Kang (2019, \textit{Pacific-Basin Finance Journal}) documented a puzzling Low Volume Return Premium (LVRP) in Korea -- contradicting global High Volume Return Premium (HVRP) evidence. We resolve this puzzle. Using Korean market data (2020-2024), we demonstrate that HVRP exists in Korea but is masked by (1) pooling heterogeneous investor types and (2) using inappropriate intensity normalization. When institutional buying intensity is normalized by market capitalization rather than trading value, a perfect monotonic relationship emerges: highest-conviction institutional buying (Q4) generates +\institutionLedQFourDayPlusFiftyCAR\ cumulative abnormal returns over 50 days, while lowest-intensity trades (Q1) yield modest returns (+\institutionLedQOneDayPlusFiftyCAR). Retail investors exhibit a flat pattern -- their trading generates near-zero returns regardless of conviction level -- confirming the pure noise trader hypothesis. During the Donghak Ant Movement (2020-2021), however, coordinated retail investors temporarily transformed from noise traders to liquidity providers, generating returns comparable to institutional trading. Our findings reconcile conflicting international evidence and demonstrate that detecting informed trading signals requires investor-type decomposition, nonlinear quartile analysis, and conviction-based (market cap) rather than participation-based (trading value) measurement.</details>

- **High-Frequency Analysis of a Trading Game with Transient Price Impact**
  - Marcel Nutz et al. | [2512.11765v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11765v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We study the high-frequency limit of an $n$-trader optimal execution game in discrete time. Traders face transient price impact of Obizhaeva--Wang type in addition to quadratic instantaneous trading costs $θ(ΔX_t)^2$ on each transaction $ΔX_t$. There is a unique Nash equilibrium in which traders choose liquidation strategies minimizing expected execution costs. In the high-frequency limit where the grid of trading dates converges to the continuous interval $[0,T]$, the discrete equilibrium inventories converge at rate $1/N$ to the continuous-time equilibrium of an Obizhaeva--Wang model with additional quadratic costs $\vartheta_0(ΔX_0)^2$ and $\vartheta_T(ΔX_T)^2$ on initial and terminal block trades, where $\vartheta_0=(n-1)/2$ and $\vartheta_T=1/2$. The latter model was introduced by Campbell and Nutz as the limit of continuous-time equilibria with vanishing instantaneous costs. Our results extend and refine previous results of Schied, Strehle, and Zhang for the particular case $n=2$ where $\vartheta_0=\vartheta_T=1/2$. In particular, we show how the coefficients $\vartheta_0=(n-1)/2$ and $\vartheta_T=1/2$ arise endogenously in the high-frequency limit: the initial and terminal block costs of the continuous-time model are identified as the limits of the cumulative discrete instantaneous costs incurred over small neighborhoods of $0$ and $T$, respectively, and these limits are independent of $θ>0$. By contrast, when $θ=0$ the discrete-time equilibrium strategies and costs exhibit persistent oscillations and admit no high-frequency limit, mirroring the non-existence of continuous-time equilibria without boundary block costs. Our results show that two different types of trading frictions -- a fine time discretization and small instantaneous costs in continuous time -- have similar regularizing effects and select a canonical model in the limit.</details>

- **Not All Factors Crowd Equally: Modeling, Measuring, and Trading on Alpha Decay**
  - Chorok Lee | [2512.11913v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11913v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We derive a specific functional form for factor alpha decay -- hyperbolic decay alpha(t) = K/(1+lambda*t) -- from a game-theoretic equilibrium model, and test it against linear and exponential alternatives. Using eight Fama-French factors (1963--2024), we find: (1) Hyperbolic decay fits mechanical factors. Momentum exhibits clear hyperbolic decay (R^2 = 0.65), outperforming linear (0.51) and exponential (0.61) baselines -- validating the equilibrium foundation. (2) Not all factors crowd equally. Mechanical factors (momentum, reversal) fit the model; judgment-based factors (value, quality) do not -- consistent with a signal-ambiguity taxonomy paralleling Hua and Sun's "barriers to entry." (3) Crowding accelerated post-2015. Out-of-sample, the model over-predicts remaining alpha (0.30 vs. 0.15), correlating with factor ETF growth (rho = -0.63). (4) Average returns are efficiently priced. Crowding-based factor selection fails to generate alpha (Sharpe: 0.22 vs. 0.39 factor momentum benchmark). (5) Crowding predicts tail risk. Out-of-sample (2001--2024), crowded reversal factors show 1.7--1.8x higher crash probability (bottom decile returns), while crowded momentum shows lower crash risk (0.38x, p = 0.006). Our findings extend equilibrium crowding models (DeMiguel et al.) to temporal dynamics and show that crowding predicts crashes, not means -- useful for risk management, not alpha generation.</details>

- **Wealth or Stealth? The Camouflage Effect in Insider Trading**
  - Jin Ma et al. | [2512.06309v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06309v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider a Kyle-type model where insider trading takes place among a potentially large population of liquidity traders and is subject to legal penalties. Insiders exploit the liquidity provided by the trading masses to "camouflage" their actions and balance expected wealth with the necessary stealth to avoid detection. Under a diverse spectrum of prosecution schemes, we establish the existence of equilibria for arbitrary population sizes and a unique limiting equilibrium. A convergence analysis determines the scale of insider trading by a stealth index $γ$, revealing that the equilibrium can be closely approximated by a simple limit due to diminished price informativeness. Empirical aspects are derived from two calibration experiments using non-overlapping data sets spanning from 1980 to 2018, which underline the indispensable role of a large population in insider trading models with legal risk, along with important implications for the incidence of stealth trading and the deterrent effect of legal enforcement.</details>

- **The Red Queen's Trap: Limits of Deep Evolution in High-Frequency Trading**
  - Yijia Chen | [2512.15732v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15732v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) is frequently hypothesized to be the "Holy Grail" of algorithmic trading, promising systems that adapt autonomously to non-stationary market regimes. This paper presents a rigorous post-mortem analysis of "Galaxy Empire," a hybrid framework coupling LSTM/Transformer-based perception with a genetic "Time-is-Life" survival mechanism. Deploying a population of 500 autonomous agents in a high-frequency cryptocurrency environment, we observed a catastrophic divergence between training metrics (Validation APY $>300\%$) and live performance (Capital Decay $>70\%$). We deconstruct this failure through a multi-disciplinary lens, identifying three critical failure modes: the overfitting of \textit{Aleatoric Uncertainty} in low-entropy time-series, the \textit{Survivor Bias} inherent in evolutionary selection under high variance, and the mathematical impossibility of overcoming microstructure friction without order-flow data. Our findings provide empirical evidence that increasing model complexity in the absence of information asymmetry exacerbates systemic fragility.</details>

- **Hidden Order in Trades Predicts the Size of Price Moves**
  - Mainak Singha | [2512.15720v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15720v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Financial markets exhibit an apparent paradox: while directional price movements remain largely unpredictable--consistent with weak-form efficiency--the magnitude of price changes displays systematic structure. Here we demonstrate that real-time order-flow entropy, computed from a 15-state Markov transition matrix at second resolution, predicts the magnitude of intraday returns without providing directional information. Analysis of 38.5 million SPY trades over 36 trading days reveals that conditioning on entropy below the 5th percentile increases subsequent 5-minute absolute returns by a factor of 2.89 (t = 12.41, p < 0.0001), while directional accuracy remains at 45.0%--statistically indistinguishable from chance (p = 0.12). This decoupling arises from a fundamental symmetry: entropy is invariant under sign permutation, detecting the presence of informed trading without revealing its direction. Walk-forward validation across five non-overlapping test periods confirms out-of-sample predictability, and label-permutation placebo tests yield z = 14.4 against the null. These findings suggest that information-theoretic measures may serve as volatility state variables in market microstructure, though the limited sample (36 days, single instrument) requires extended validation.</details>

- **A Hybrid Architecture for Options Wheel Strategy Decisions: LLM-Generated Bayesian Networks for Transparent Trading**
  - Xiaoting Kuang et al. | [2512.01123v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01123v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding context and qualitative nuances but struggle with the rigorous and transparent reasoning required in high-stakes quantitative domains such as financial trading. We propose a model-first hybrid architecture for the options "wheel" strategy that combines the strengths of LLMs with the robustness of a Bayesian Network. Rather than using the LLM as a black-box decision-maker, we employ it as an intelligent model builder. For each trade decision, the LLM constructs a context-specific Bayesian network by interpreting current market conditions, including prices, volatility, trends, and news, and hypothesizing relationships among key variables. The LLM also selects relevant historical data from an 18.75-year, 8,919-trade dataset to populate the network's conditional probability tables. This selection focuses on scenarios analogous to the present context. The instantiated Bayesian network then performs transparent probabilistic inference, producing explicit probability distributions and risk metrics to support decision-making. A feedback loop enables the LLM to analyze trade outcomes and iteratively refine subsequent network structures and data selection, learning from both successes and failures. Empirically, our hybrid system demonstrates effective performance on the wheel strategy. Over nearly 19 years of out-of-sample testing, it achieves a 15.3% annualized return with significantly superior risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio 1.08 versus 0.62 for market benchmarks) and dramatically lower drawdown (-8.2% versus -60%) while maintaining a 0% assignment rate through strategic option rolling. Crucially, each trade decision is fully explainable, involving on average 27 recorded decision factors (e.g., volatility level, option premium, risk indicators, market context).</details>

- **Integration of LSTM Networks in Random Forest Algorithms for Stock Market Trading Predictions**
  - Juan C. King et al. | [2512.02036v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02036v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The aim of this paper is the analysis and selection of stock trading systems that combine different models with data of different nature, such as financial and microeconomic information. Specifically, based on previous work by the authors and applying advanced techniques of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, our objective is to formulate trading algorithms for the stock market with empirically tested statistical advantages, thus improving results published in the literature. Our approach integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with algorithms based on decision trees, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. While the former analyze price patterns of financial assets, the latter are fed with economic data of companies. Numerical simulations of algorithmic trading with data from international companies and 10-weekday predictions confirm that an approach based on both fundamental and technical variables can outperform the usual approaches, which do not combine those two types of variables. In doing so, Random Forest turned out to be the best performer among the decision trees. We also discuss how the prediction performance of such a hybrid approach can be boosted by selecting the technical variables.</details>

- **Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Stock Trading: An Ensemble Strategy**
  - Hongyang Yang et al. | [2511.12120v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12120v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Stock trading strategies play a critical role in investment. However, it is challenging to design a profitable strategy in a complex and dynamic stock market. In this paper, we propose an ensemble strategy that employs deep reinforcement schemes to learn a stock trading strategy by maximizing investment return. We train a deep reinforcement learning agent and obtain an ensemble trading strategy using three actor-critic based algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The ensemble strategy inherits and integrates the best features of the three algorithms, thereby robustly adjusting to different market situations. In order to avoid the large memory consumption in training networks with continuous action space, we employ a load-on-demand technique for processing very large data. We test our algorithms on the 30 Dow Jones stocks that have adequate liquidity. The performance of the trading agent with different reinforcement learning algorithms is evaluated and compared with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and the traditional min-variance portfolio allocation strategy. The proposed deep ensemble strategy is shown to outperform the three individual algorithms and two baselines in terms of the risk-adjusted return measured by the Sharpe ratio.

- **An extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Trees approach to Detect and Identify Unlawful Insider Trading (UIT) Transactions**
  - Krishna Neupane et al. | [2511.08306v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08306v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Corporate insiders have control of material non-public preferential information (MNPI). Occasionally, the insiders strategically bypass legal and regulatory safeguards to exploit MNPI in their execution of securities trading. Due to a large volume of transactions a detection of unlawful insider trading becomes an arduous task for humans to examine and identify underlying patterns from the insider's behavior. On the other hand, innovative machine learning architectures have shown promising results for analyzing large-scale and complex data with hidden patterns. One such popular technique is eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), the state-of-the-arts supervised classifier. We, hence, resort to and apply XGBoost to alleviate challenges of identification and detection of unlawful activities. The results demonstrate that XGBoost can identify unlawful transactions with a high accuracy of 97 percent and can provide ranking of the features that play the most important role in detecting fraudulent activities.</details>

- **JaxMARL-HFT: GPU-Accelerated Large-Scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading**
  - Valentin Mohl et al. | [2511.02136v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02136v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Agent-based modelling (ABM) approaches for high-frequency financial markets are difficult to calibrate and validate, partly due to the large parameter space created by defining fixed agent policies. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) enables more realistic agent behaviour and reduces the number of free parameters, but the heavy computational cost has so far limited research efforts. To address this, we introduce JaxMARL-HFT (JAX-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for High-Frequency Trading), the first GPU-accelerated open-source multi-agent reinforcement learning environment for high-frequency trading (HFT) on market-by-order (MBO) data. Extending the JaxMARL framework and building on the JAX-LOB implementation, JaxMARL-HFT is designed to handle a heterogeneous set of agents, enabling diverse observation/action spaces and reward functions. It is designed flexibly, so it can also be used for single-agent RL, or extended to act as an ABM with fixed-policy agents. Leveraging JAX enables up to a 240x reduction in end-to-end training time, compared with state-of-the-art reference implementations on the same hardware. This significant speed-up makes it feasible to exploit the large, granular datasets available in high-frequency trading, and to perform the extensive hyperparameter sweeps required for robust and efficient MARL research in trading. We demonstrate the use of JaxMARL-HFT with independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) for a two-player environment, with an order execution and a market making agent, using one year of LOB data (400 million orders), and show that these agents learn to outperform standard benchmarks. The code for the JaxMARL-HFT framework is available on GitHub.</details>


- **Trade Execution Flow as the Underlying Source of Market Dynamics**
  - Mikhail Gennadievich Belov et al. | [2511.01471v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01471v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this work, we demonstrate experimentally that the execution flow, $I = dV/dt$, is the fundamental driving force of market dynamics. We develop a numerical framework to calculate execution flow from sampled moments using the Radon-Nikodym derivative. A notable feature of this approach is its ability to automatically determine thresholds that can serve as actionable triggers. The technique also determines the characteristic time scale directly from the corresponding eigenproblem. The methodology has been validated on actual market data to support these findings. Additionally, we introduce a framework based on the Christoffel function spectrum, which is invariant under arbitrary non-degenerate linear transformations of input attributes and offers an alternative to traditional principal component analysis (PCA), which is limited to unitary invariance.</details>

- **Deep reinforcement learning for optimal trading with partial information**
  - Andrea Macrì et al. | [2511.00190v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00190v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Reinforcement Learning (RL) applied to financial problems has been the subject of a lively area of research. The use of RL for optimal trading strategies that exploit latent information in the market is, to the best of our knowledge, not widely tackled. In this paper we study an optimal trading problem, where a trading signal follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with regime-switching dynamics. We employ a blend of RL and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in order to make the most at extracting underlying information from the trading signal with latent parameters.   The latent parameters driving mean reversion, speed, and volatility are filtered from observations of the signal, and trading strategies are derived via RL. To address this problem, we propose three Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based algorithms that integrate Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks to capture temporal dependencies in the signal. The first, a one -step approach (hid-DDPG), directly encodes hidden states from the GRU into the RL trader. The second and third are two-step methods: one (prob-DDPG) makes use of posterior regime probability estimates, while the other (reg-DDPG) relies on forecasts of the next signal value. Through extensive simulations with increasingly complex Markovian regime dynamics for the trading signal's parameters, as well as an empirical application to equity pair trading, we find that prob-DDPG achieves superior cumulative rewards and exhibits more interpretable strategies. By contrast, reg-DDPG provides limited benefits, while hid-DDPG offers intermediate performance with less interpretable strategies. Our results show that the quality and structure of the information supplied to the agent are crucial: embedding probabilistic insights into latent regimes substantially improves both profitability and robustness of reinforcement learning-based trading strategies.</details>


- **When AI Trading Agents Compete: Adverse Selection of Meta-Orders by Reinforcement Learning-Based Market Making**
  - Ali Raza Jafree et al. | [2510.27334v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27334v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We investigate the mechanisms by which medium-frequency trading agents are adversely selected by opportunistic high-frequency traders. We use reinforcement learning (RL) within a Hawkes Limit Order Book (LOB) model in order to replicate the behaviours of high-frequency market makers. In contrast to the classical models with exogenous price impact assumptions, the Hawkes model accounts for endogenous price impact and other key properties of the market (Jain et al. 2024a). Given the real-world impracticalities of the market maker updating strategies for every event in the LOB, we formulate the high-frequency market making agent via an impulse control reinforcement learning framework (Jain et al. 2025). The RL used in the simulation utilises Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) and self-imitation learning. To replicate the adverse selection phenomenon, we test the RL agent trading against a medium frequency trader (MFT) executing a meta-order and demonstrate that, with training against the MFT meta-order execution agent, the RL market making agent learns to capitalise on the price drift induced by the meta-order. Recent empirical studies have shown that medium-frequency traders are increasingly subject to adverse selection by high-frequency trading agents. As high-frequency trading continues to proliferate across financial markets, the slippage costs incurred by medium-frequency traders are likely to increase over time. However, we do not observe that increased profits for the market making RL agent necessarily cause significantly increased slippages for the MFT agent.</details>

  - Avirup Chakraborty | [2510.22341v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22341v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the worlds largest cap-and-trade carbon market, is central to EU climate policy. This study analyzes its efficiency, price behavior, and market structure from 2010 to 2020. Using an AR-GARCH framework, we find pronounced price clustering and short-term return predictability, with 60.05 percent directional accuracy and a 70.78 percent hit rate within forecast intervals. Network analysis of inter-country transactions shows a concentrated structure dominated by a few registries that control most high-value flows. Country-specific log-log regressions of price on traded quantity reveal heterogeneous and sometimes positive elasticities exceeding unity, implying that trading volumes often rise with prices. These results point to persistent inefficiencies in the EU ETS, including partial predictability, asymmetric market power, and unconventional price-volume relationships, suggesting that while the system contributes to decarbonization, its trading dynamics and price formation remain imperfect.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The financial market is known to be highly sensitive to news. Therefore, effectively incorporating news data into quantitative trading remains an important challenge. Existing approaches typically rely on manually designed rules and/or handcrafted features. In this work, we directly use the news sentiment scores derived from large language models, together with raw price and volume data, as observable inputs for reinforcement learning. These inputs are processed by sequence models such as recurrent neural networks or Transformers to make end-to-end trading decisions. We conduct experiments using the cryptocurrency market as an example and evaluate two representative reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The results demonstrate that our news-aware approach, which does not depend on handcrafted features or manually designed rules, can achieve performance superior to market benchmarks. We further highlight the critical role of time-series information in this process.</details>

  - Jinrui Zhang | [2510.17165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17165v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Foundation models - already transformative in domains such as natural language processing - are now starting to emerge for time-series tasks in finance. While these pretrained architectures promise versatile predictive signals, little is known about how they shape the risk profiles of the trading strategies built atop them, leaving practitioners reluctant to commit serious capital. In this paper, we propose an extension to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that disentangles the systematic risk introduced by a shared foundation model - potentially capable of generating alpha if the underlying model is genuinely predictive - from the idiosyncratic risk attributable to custom fine-tuning, which typically accrues no systematic premium. To enable a practical estimation of these separate risks, we align this decomposition with the concepts of uncertainty disentanglement, casting systematic risk as epistemic uncertainty (rooted in the pretrained model) and idiosyncratic risk as aleatory uncertainty (introduced during custom adaptations). Under the Aleatory Collapse Assumption, we illustrate how Monte Carlo dropout - among other methods in the uncertainty-quantization toolkit - can directly measure the epistemic risk, thereby mapping trading strategies to a more transparent risk-return plane. Our experiments show that isolating these distinct risk factors yields deeper insights into the performance limits of foundation-model-based strategies, their model degradation over time, and potential avenues for targeted refinements. Taken together, our results highlight both the promise and the pitfalls of deploying large pretrained models in competitive financial markets.</details>

  - Daniel Cunha Oliveira et al. | [2510.12725v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12725v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Robust optimization provides a principled framework for decision-making under uncertainty, with broad applications in finance, engineering, and operations research. In portfolio optimization, uncertainty in expected returns and covariances demands methods that mitigate estimation error, parameter instability, and model misspecification. Traditional approaches, including parametric, bootstrap-based, and Bayesian methods, enhance stability by relying on confidence intervals or probabilistic priors but often impose restrictive assumptions. This study introduces a non-parametric bootstrap framework for robust optimization in financial decision-making. By resampling empirical data, the framework constructs flexible, data-driven confidence intervals without assuming specific distributional forms, thus capturing uncertainty in statistical estimates, model parameters, and utility functions. Treating utility as a random variable enables percentile-based optimization, naturally suited for risk-sensitive and worst-case decision-making. The approach aligns with recent advances in robust optimization, reinforcement learning, and risk-aware control, offering a unified perspective on robustness and generalization. Empirically, the framework mitigates overfitting and selection bias in trading strategy optimization and improves generalization in portfolio allocation. Results across portfolio and time-series momentum experiments demonstrate that the proposed method delivers smoother, more stable out-of-sample performance, offering a practical, distribution-free alternative to traditional robust optimization methods.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large language models show promise for financial decision-making, yet deploying them as autonomous trading agents raises fundamental challenges: how to adapt instructions when rewards arrive late and obscured by market noise, how to synthesize heterogeneous information streams into coherent decisions, and how to bridge the gap between model outputs and executable market actions. We present ATLAS (Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS), a unified multi-agent framework that integrates structured information from markets, news, and corporate fundamentals to support robust trading decisions. Within ATLAS, the central trading agent operates in an order-aware action space, ensuring that outputs correspond to executable market orders rather than abstract signals. The agent can incorporate feedback while trading using Adaptive-OPRO, a novel prompt-optimization technique that dynamically adapts the prompt by incorporating real-time, stochastic feedback, leading to increasing performance over time. Across regime-specific equity studies and multiple LLM families, Adaptive-OPRO consistently outperforms fixed prompts, while reflection-based feedback fails to provide systematic gains.</details>

- **An Adaptive Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading System**
  - Aadi Singhi | [2510.08068v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08068v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents a Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading system that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) for alpha generation and portfolio management in the cryptocurrencies market. Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data. The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and performance reflection. The agents improve over time via a novel verbal feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are then injected into future prompts of the agents, allowing them to adjust allocation logic without weight updates or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025 shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantitative agent delivered over 30\% higher returns in bullish phases and 15\% overall gains versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets from a small loss into a gain of over 100\%. Adding weekly feedback further improved total performance by 31\% and reduced bearish losses by 10\%. The results demonstrate that verbal feedback represents a new, scalable, and low-cost approach of tuning LLMs for financial goals.</details>

  - Weilong Fu | [2510.05533v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05533v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large language models are reshaping quantitative investing by turning unstructured financial information into evidence-grounded signals and executable decisions. This survey synthesizes research with a focus on equity return prediction and trading, consolidating insights from domain surveys and more than fifty primary studies. We propose a task-centered taxonomy that spans sentiment and event extraction, numerical and economic reasoning, multimodal understanding, retrieval-augmented generation, time series prompting, and agentic systems that coordinate tools for research, backtesting, and execution. We review empirical evidence for predictability, highlight design patterns that improve faithfulness such as retrieval first prompting and tool-verified numerics, and explain how signals feed portfolio construction under exposure, turnover, and capacity controls. We assess benchmarks and datasets for prediction and trading and outline desiderata-for time safe and economically meaningful evaluation that reports costs, latency, and capacity. We analyze challenges that matter in production, including temporal leakage, hallucination, data coverage and structure, deployment economics, interpretability, governance, and safety. The survey closes with recommendations for standardizing evaluation, building auditable pipelines, and advancing multilingual and cross-market research so that language-driven systems deliver robust and risk-controlled performance in practice.</details>

  - Mingshu Li et al. | [2509.24151v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24151v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Accurately measuring portfolio similarity is critical for a wide range of financial applications, including Exchange-traded Fund (ETF) recommendation, portfolio trading, and risk alignment. Existing similarity measures often rely on exact asset overlap or static distance metrics, which fail to capture similarities among the constituents (e.g., securities within the portfolio) as well as nuanced relationships between partially overlapping portfolios with heterogeneous weights. We introduce STRAPSim (Semantic, Two-level, Residual-Aware Portfolio Similarity), a novel method that computes portfolio similarity by matching constituents based on semantic similarity, weighting them according to their portfolio share, and aggregating results via residual-aware greedy alignment. We benchmark our approach against Jaccard, weighted Jaccard, as well as BERTScore-inspired variants across public classification, regression, and recommendation tasks, as well as on corporate bond ETF datasets. Empirical results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in predictive accuracy and ranking alignment, achieving the highest Spearman correlation with return-based similarity. By leveraging constituent-aware matching and dynamic reweighting, portfolio similarity offers a scalable, interpretable framework for comparing structured asset baskets, demonstrating its utility in ETF benchmarking, portfolio construction, and systematic execution.</details>

  - Axel Ciceri et al. | [2509.17715v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17715v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The estimation of fill probabilities for trade orders represents a key ingredient in the optimization of algorithmic trading strategies. It is bound by the complex dynamics of financial markets with inherent uncertainties, and the limitations of models aiming to learn from multivariate financial time series that often exhibit stochastic properties with hidden temporal patterns. In this paper, we focus on algorithmic responses to trade inquiries in the corporate bond market and investigate fill probability estimation errors of common machine learning models when given real production-scale intraday trade event data, transformed by a quantum algorithm running on IBM Heron processors, as well as on noiseless quantum simulators for comparison. We introduce a framework to embed these quantum-generated data transforms as a decoupled offline component that can be selectively queried by models in low-latency institutional trade optimization settings. A trade execution backtesting method is employed to evaluate the fill prediction performance of these models in relation to their input data. We observe a relative gain of up to ~ 34% in out-of-sample test scores for those models with access to quantum hardware-transformed data over those using the original trading data or transforms by noiseless quantum simulation. These empirical results suggest that the inherent noise in current quantum hardware contributes to this effect and motivates further studies. Our work demonstrates the emerging potential of quantum computing as a complementary explorative tool in quantitative finance and encourages applied industry research towards practical applications in trading.</details>

  - Sid Ghatak et al. | [2509.16707v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16707v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>There are inefficiencies in financial markets, with unexploited patterns in price, volume, and cross-sectional relationships. While many approaches use large-scale transformers, we take a domain-focused path: feed-forward and recurrent networks with curated features to capture subtle regularities in noisy financial data. This smaller-footprint design is computationally lean and reliable under low signal-to-noise, crucial for daily production at scale. At Increase Alpha, we built a deep-learning framework that maps over 800 U.S. equities into daily directional signals with minimal computational overhead.   The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, we outline the general overview of the predictive model without disclosing its core underlying concepts. Second, we evaluate its real-time performance through transparent, industry standard metrics. Forecast accuracy is benchmarked against both naive baselines and macro indicators. The performance outcomes are summarized via cumulative returns, annualized Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. The best portfolio combination using our signals provides a low-risk, continuous stream of returns with a Sharpe ratio of more than 2.5, maximum drawdown of around 3%, and a near-zero correlation with the S&P 500 market benchmark. We also compare the model's performance through different market regimes, such as the recent volatile movements of the US equity market in the beginning of 2025. Our analysis showcases the robustness of the model and significantly stable performance during these volatile periods.   Collectively, these findings show that market inefficiencies can be systematically harvested with modest computational overhead if the right variables are considered. This report will emphasize the potential of traditional deep learning frameworks for generating an AI-driven edge in the financial market.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Developing professional, structured reasoning on par with human financial analysts and traders remains a central challenge in AI for finance, where markets demand interpretability and trust. Traditional time-series models lack explainability, while LLMs face challenges in turning natural-language analysis into disciplined, executable trades. Although reasoning LLMs have advanced in step-by-step planning and verification, their application to risk-sensitive financial decisions is underexplored. We present Trading-R1, a financially-aware model that incorporates strategic thinking and planning for comprehensive thesis composition, facts-grounded analysis, and volatility-adjusted decision making. Trading-R1 aligns reasoning with trading principles through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with a three-stage easy-to-hard curriculum. Training uses Tauric-TR1-DB, a 100k-sample corpus spanning 18 months, 14 equities, and five heterogeneous financial data sources. Evaluated on six major equities and ETFs, Trading-R1 demonstrates improved risk-adjusted returns and lower drawdowns compared to both open-source and proprietary instruction-following models as well as reasoning models. The system generates structured, evidence-based investment theses that support disciplined and interpretable trading decisions.

  - Yang Chen et al. | [2509.05080v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05080v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The inherent non-stationarity of financial markets and the complexity of multi-modal information pose significant challenges to existing quantitative trading models. Traditional methods relying on fixed structures and unimodal data struggle to adapt to market regime shifts, while large language model (LLM)-driven solutions - despite their multi-modal comprehension - suffer from static strategies and homogeneous expert designs, lacking dynamic adjustment and fine-grained decision mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose MM-DREX: a Multimodal-driven, Dynamically-Routed EXpert framework based on large language models. MM-DREX explicitly decouples market state perception from strategy execution to enable adaptive sequential decision-making in non-stationary environments. Specifically, it (1) introduces a vision-language model (VLM)-powered dynamic router that jointly analyzes candlestick chart patterns and long-term temporal features to allocate real-time expert weights; (2) designs four heterogeneous trading experts (trend, reversal, breakout, positioning) generating specialized fine-grained sub-strategies; and (3) proposes an SFT-RL hybrid training paradigm to synergistically optimize the router's market classification capability and experts' risk-adjusted decision-making. Extensive experiments on multi-modal datasets spanning stocks, futures, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that MM-DREX significantly outperforms 15 baselines (including state-of-the-art financial LLMs and deep reinforcement learning models) across key metrics: total return, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, validating its robustness and generalization. Additionally, an interpretability module traces routing logic and expert behavior in real time, providing an audit trail for strategy transparency.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists use different metrics to evaluate model performance.   We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss (PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization, a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within predefined limits.   Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.</details>

  - Qizhao Chen et al. | [2509.01393v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01393v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework that employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to dynamically optimize the weights of multiple large language model (LLM)-generated formulaic alphas for stock trading strategies. Formulaic alphas are mathematically defined trading signals derived from price, volume, sentiment, and other data. Although recent studies have shown that LLMs can generate diverse and effective alphas, a critical challenge lies in how to adaptively integrate them under varying market conditions. To address this gap, we leverage the deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b model to generate fifty alphas for five major stocks: Apple, HSBC, Pepsi, Toyota, and Tencent, and then use PPO to adjust their weights in real time. Experimental results demonstrate that the PPO-optimized strategy achieves strong returns and high Sharpe ratios across most stocks, outperforming both an equal-weighted alpha portfolio and traditional benchmarks such as the Nikkei 225, S&P 500, and Hang Seng Index. The findings highlight the importance of reinforcement learning in the allocation of alpha weights and show the potential of combining LLM-generated signals with adaptive optimization for robust financial forecasting and trading.</details>

  - Mateusz Wilinski et al. | [2508.20672v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20672v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>There are multiple explanations for stylized facts in high-frequency trading, including adaptive and informed agents, many of which have been studied through agent-based models. This paper investigates an alternative explanation by examining whether, and under what circumstances, interactions between traders placing limit order book messages can reproduce stylized facts, and what forms of interaction are required. While the agent-based modeling literature has introduced interconnected agents on networks, little attention has been paid to whether specific trading network topologies can generate stylized facts in limit order book markets. In our model, agents are strictly zero-intelligence, with no fundamental knowledge or chartist-like strategies, so that the role of network topology can be isolated. We find that scale-free connectivity between agents reproduces stylized facts observed in markets, whereas no-interaction does not. Our experiments show that regular lattices and Erdos-Renyi networks are not significantly different from the no-interaction baseline. Thus, we provide a completely new, potentially complementary, explanation for the emergence of stylized facts.</details>

  - Xiangdong Liu et al. | [2508.20467v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20467v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23 years of S&P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9 baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and downside risk control.

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this study, we wish to showcase the unique utility of large language models (LLMs) in financial semantic annotation and alpha signal discovery. Leveraging a corpus of company-related tweets, we use an LLM to automatically assign multi-label event categories to high-sentiment-intensity tweets. We align these labeled sentiment signals with forward returns over 1-to-7-day horizons to evaluate their statistical efficacy and market tradability. Our experiments reveal that certain event labels consistently yield negative alpha, with Sharpe ratios as low as -0.38 and information coefficients exceeding 0.05, all statistically significant at the 95\% confidence level. This study establishes the feasibility of transforming unstructured social media text into structured, multi-label event variables. A key contribution of this work is its commitment to transparency and reproducibility; all code and methodologies are made publicly available. Our results provide compelling evidence that social media sentiment is a valuable, albeit noisy, signal in financial forecasting and underscore the potential of open-source frameworks to democratize algorithmic trading research.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper we study the quality of model-free valuation approaches for financial derivatives by systematically evaluating the difference between model-free super-hedging strategies and the realized payoff of financial derivatives using historical option prices from several constituents of the S&P 500 between 2018 and 2022.   Our study allows in particular to describe the realized gap between payoff and model-free hedging strategy empirically so that we can quantify to which degree model-free approaches are overly conservative. Our results imply that the model-free hedging approach is only marginally more conservative than industry-standard models such as the Heston-model while being model-free at the same time.   This finding, its statistical description and the model-independence of the hedging approach enable us to construct an explicit trading strategy which, as we demonstrate, can be profitably applied in financial markets, and additionally possesses the desirable feature with an explicit control of its downside risk due to its model-free construction preventing losses pathwise.</details>

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer complementary strategic reasoning and multi-modal signal interpretation when guided by well-structured prompts. This paper proposes a hybrid framework in which LLMs generate high-level trading strategies to guide RL agents. We evaluate (i) the economic rationale of LLM-generated strategies through expert review, and (ii) the performance of LLM-guided agents against unguided RL baselines using Sharpe Ratio (SR) and Maximum Drawdown (MDD). Empirical results indicate that LLM guidance improves both return and risk metrics relative to standard RL.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Straddle Option is a financial trading tool that explores volatility premiums in high-volatility markets without predicting price direction. Although deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful approach to trading automation in financial markets, existing work mostly focused on predicting price trends and making trading decisions by combining multi-dimensional datasets like blogs and videos, which led to high computational costs and unstable performance in high-volatility markets. To tackle this challenge, we develop automated straddle option trading based on reinforcement learning and attention mechanisms to handle unpredictability in high-volatility markets. Firstly, we leverage the attention mechanisms in Transformer-DDQN through both self-attention with time series data and channel attention with multi-cycle information. Secondly, a novel reward function considering excess earnings is designed to focus on long-term profits and neglect short-term losses over a stop line. Thirdly, we identify the resistance levels to provide reference information when great uncertainty in price movements occurs with intensified battle between the buyers and sellers. Through extensive experiments on the Chinese stock, Brent crude oil, and Bitcoin markets, our attention-based Transformer-DDQN model exhibits the lowest maximum drawdown across all markets, and outperforms other models by 92.5\% in terms of the average return excluding the crude oil market due to relatively low fluctuation.</details>

However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance.

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>As decentralized finance (DeFi) evolves, distinguishing between user behaviors - liquidity provision versus active trading - has become vital for risk modeling and on-chain reputation. We propose a behavioral scoring framework for Uniswap that assigns two complementary scores: a Liquidity Provision Score that assesses strategic liquidity contributions, and a Swap Behavior Score that reflects trading intent, volatility exposure, and discipline. The scores are constructed using rule-based blueprints that decompose behavior into volume, frequency, holding time, and withdrawal patterns. To handle edge cases and learn feature interactions, we introduce a deep residual neural network with densely connected skip blocks inspired by the U-Net architecture. We also incorporate pool-level context such as total value locked (TVL), fee tiers, and pool size, allowing the system to differentiate similar user behaviors across pools with varying characteristics. Our framework enables context-aware and scalable DeFi user scoring, supporting improved risk assessment and incentive design. Experiments on Uniswap v3 data show its usefulness for user segmentation and protocol-aligned reputation systems. Although we refer to our metric as zScore, it is independently developed and methodologically different from the cross-protocol system proposed by Udupi et al. Our focus is on role-specific behavioral modeling within Uniswap using blueprint logic and supervised learning.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have transformed fields such as computer vision and natural language processing by employing architectures aligned with domain-specific structural patterns. In algorithmic trading, however, there remains a lack of architectures that directly incorporate the logic of traditional technical indicators. This study introduces Technical Indicator Networks (TINs), a structured neural design that reformulates rule-based financial heuristics into trainable and interpretable modules. The architecture preserves the core mathematical definitions of conventional indicators while extending them to multidimensional data and supporting optimization through diverse learning paradigms, including reinforcement learning. Analytical transformations such as averaging, clipping, and ratio computation are expressed as vectorized layer operators, enabling transparent network construction and principled initialization. This formulation retains the clarity and interpretability of classical strategies while allowing adaptive adjustment and data-driven refinement. As a proof of concept, the framework is validated on the Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents using a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) TIN. Empirical results demonstrate improved risk-adjusted performance relative to traditional indicator-based strategies. Overall, the findings suggest that TINs provide a generalizable foundation for interpretable, adaptive, and extensible learning architectures in structured decision-making domains and indicate substantial commercial potential for upgrading trading platforms with cross-market visibility and enhanced decision-support capabilities.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs) have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However, the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO, the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel 'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way, simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider a dynamic portfolio optimization problem that incorporates predictable returns, instantaneous transaction costs, price impact, and stochastic volatility, extending the classical results of Garleanu and Pedersen (2013), which assume constant volatility. Constructing the optimal portfolio strategy in this general setting is challenging due to the nonlinear nature of the resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. To address this, we propose a multi-scale volatility expansion that captures stochastic volatility dynamics across different time scales. Specifically, the analysis involves a singular perturbation for the fast mean-reverting volatility factor and a regular perturbation for the slow-moving factor. We also introduce an approximation for small price impact and demonstrate its numerical accuracy. We formally derive asymptotic approximations up to second order and use Monte Carlo simulations to show how incorporating these corrections improves the Profit and Loss (PnL) of the resulting portfolio strategy.</details>

Building on the theoretical results of (Muca Cirone and Salvi, 2025), we parameterise trading strategies as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), enabling a flexible and non-Markovian approach to optimal portfolio problems. We compare this with the signature-based framework of (Futter, Horvath, Wiese, 2023) and demonstrate that both significantly outperform classical Markovian methods when the asset dynamics or predictive signals exhibit temporal dependencies for both synthetic and market-data examples. Using kernels in this context provides significant modelling flexibility, as the choice of feature embedding can range from randomised signatures to the final layers of neural network architectures. Crucially, our framework retains closed-form solutions and provides an alternative to gradient-based optimisation.</details>

We define bridging orders and show that the resulting execution is slippage free and capital preserving for LPs. Applied to real world Arbitrum swap data, our algorithm demonstrates efficient discovery of CoW cycles and supports the insertion of synthetic orders for atomic cycle closure.

Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning approaches typically demand large training datasets and encode diverse inputs into numerical representations, often at the cost of interpretability. Recent progress in large language model (LLM)-based agents has demonstrated the capacity to process multi-modal data and support complex investment decision-making. Building on these advances, we present \textbf{MountainLion}, a multi-modal, multi-agent system for financial trading that coordinates specialized LLM-based agents to interpret financial data and generate investment strategies. MountainLion processes textual news, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts to produce high-quality financial reports, while also enabling modification of reports and investment recommendations through data-driven user interaction and question answering. A central reflection module analyzes historical trading signals and outcomes to continuously refine decision processes, and the system is capable of real-time report analysis, summarization, and dynamic adjustment of investment strategies. Empirical results confirm that MountainLion systematically enriches technical price triggers with contextual macroeconomic and capital flow signals, providing a more interpretable, robust, and actionable investment framework that improves returns and strengthens investor confidence.</details>

- **A Framework for Predictive Directional Trading Based on Volatility and Causal Inference**
  - Ivan Letteri | [2507.09347v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09347v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Purpose: This study introduces a novel framework for identifying and exploiting predictive lead-lag relationships in financial markets. We propose an integrated approach that combines advanced statistical methodologies with machine learning models to enhance the identification and exploitation of predictive relationships between equities. Methods: We employed a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster nine prominent stocks based on their mid-range historical volatility profiles over a three-year period. From the resulting clusters, we constructed a multi-stage causal inference pipeline, incorporating the Granger Causality Test (GCT), a customised Peter-Clark Momentary Conditional Independence (PCMCI) test, and Effective Transfer Entropy (ETE) to identify robust, predictive linkages. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier were utilised to determine the optimal time lag for trade execution. The resulting strategy was rigorously backtested. Results: The proposed volatility-based trading strategy, tested from 8 June 2023 to 12 August 2023, demonstrated substantial efficacy. The portfolio yielded a total return of 15.38%, significantly outperforming the 10.39% return of a comparative Buy-and-Hold strategy. Key performance metrics, including a Sharpe Ratio up to 2.17 and a win rate up to 100% for certain pairs, confirmed the strategy's viability. Conclusion: This research contributes a systematic and robust methodology for identifying profitable trading opportunities derived from volatility-based causal relationships. The findings have significant implications for both academic research in financial modelling and the practical application of algorithmic trading, offering a structured approach to developing resilient, data-driven strategies.</details>

- **To Trade or Not to Trade: An Agentic Approach to Estimating Market Risk Improves Trading Decisions**
  - Dimitrios Emmanoulopoulos et al. | [2507.08584v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08584v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks, in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal. While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading decisions.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In this paper, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework for optimal trade execution in a limit order book. We formulate the trade execution problem as a dynamic allocation task whose objective is the optimal placement of market and limit orders to maximize expected revenue. By employing multivariate logistic-normal distributions to model random allocations, the framework enables efficient training of the reinforcement learning algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms traditional benchmark strategies in simulated limit order book environments featuring noise traders submitting random orders, tactical traders responding to order book imbalances, and a strategic trader seeking to acquire or liquidate an asset position.</details>

- **Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market**
  - Chi-Sheng Chen et al. | [2506.20930v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20930v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely, the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum reinforcement learning in real-world finance.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We examine strategically incorporating broad stock market leveraged exchange-traded funds (LETFs) into investment portfolios. We demonstrate that easily understandable and implementable strategies can enhance the risk-return profile of a portfolio containing LETFs. Our analysis shows that seemingly reasonable investment strategies may result in undesirable Omega ratios, with these effects compounding across rebalancing periods. By contrast, relatively simple dynamic strategies that systematically de-risk the portfolio once gains are observed can exploit this compounding effect, taking advantage of favorable Omega ratio dynamics. Our findings suggest that LETFs represent a valuable tool for investors employing dynamic strategies, while confirming their well-documented unsuitability for passive or static approaches.</details>

  - Mateusz Wilinski et al. | [2505.21662v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21662v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The rapid development of sophisticated machine learning methods, together with the increased availability of financial data, has the potential to transform financial research, but also poses a challenge in terms of validation and interpretation. A good case study is the task of classifying financial investors based on their behavioral patterns. Not only do we have access to both classification and clustering tools for high-dimensional data, but also data identifying individual investors is finally available. The problem, however, is that we do not have access to ground truth when working with real-world data. This, together with often limited interpretability of modern machine learning methods, makes it difficult to fully utilize the available research potential. In order to deal with this challenge we propose to use a realistic agent-based model as a way to generate synthetic data. This way one has access to ground truth, large replicable data, and limitless research scenarios. Using this approach we show how, even when classifying trading agents in a supervised manner is relatively easy, a more realistic task of unsupervised clustering may give incorrect or even misleading results. We complete the results with investigating the details of how supervised techniques were able to successfully distinguish between different trading behaviors.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This study replicates the findings of Wang et al. (2017) on reference-dependent preferences and their impact on the risk-return trade-off in the Chinese stock market, a unique context characterized by high retail investor participation, speculative trading behavior, and regulatory complexities. Capital Gains Overhang (CGO), a proxy for unrealized gains or losses, is employed to explore how behavioral biases shape cross-sectional stock returns in an emerging market setting. Utilizing data from 1995 to 2024 and econometric techniques such as Dependent Double Sorting and Fama-MacBeth regressions, this research investigates the interaction between CGO and five risk proxies: Beta, Return Volatility (RETVOL), Idiosyncratic Volatility (IVOL), Firm Age (AGE), and Cash Flow Volatility (CFVOL). Key findings reveal a weaker or absent positive risk-return relationship among high-CGO firms and stronger positive relationships among low-CGO firms, diverging from U.S. market results, and the interaction effects between CGO and risk proxies, significant and positive in the U.S., are predominantly negative in the Chinese market, reflecting structural and behavioral differences, such as speculative trading and diminished reliance on reference points. The results suggest that reference-dependent preferences play a less pronounced role in the Chinese market, emphasizing the need for tailored investment strategies in emerging economies.</details>

  - Yang Li et al. | [2505.05784v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05784v3)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>High-frequency trading (HFT) is an investing strategy that continuously monitors market states and places bid and ask orders at millisecond speeds. Traditional HFT approaches fit models with historical data and assume that future market states follow similar patterns. This limits the effectiveness of any single model to the specific conditions it was trained for. Additionally, these models achieve optimal solutions only under specific market conditions, such as assumptions about stock price's stochastic process, stable order flow, and the absence of sudden volatility. Real-world markets, however, are dynamic, diverse, and frequently volatile. To address these challenges, we propose the FlowHFT, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching policy. FlowHFT simultaneously learns strategies from numerous expert models, each proficient in particular market scenarios. As a result, our framework can adaptively adjust investment decisions according to the prevailing market state. Furthermore, FlowHFT incorporates a grid-search fine-tuning mechanism. This allows it to refine strategies and achieve superior performance even in complex or extreme market scenarios where expert strategies may be suboptimal. We test FlowHFT in multiple market environments. We first show that flow matching policy is applicable in stochastic market environments, thus enabling FlowHFT to learn trading strategies under different market conditions. Notably, our single framework consistently achieves performance superior to the best expert for each market condition.</details>

  - Yichi Zhang et al. | [2504.20349v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20349v3)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>In the rapidly evolving world of financial markets, understanding the dynamics of limit order book (LOB) is crucial for unraveling market microstructure and participant behavior. We introduce ClusterLOB as a method to cluster individual market events in a stream of market-by-order (MBO) data into different groups. To do so, each market event is augmented with six time-dependent features. By applying the K-means++ clustering algorithm to the resulting order features, we are then able to assign each new order to one of three distinct clusters, which we identify as directional, opportunistic, and market-making participants, each capturing unique trading behaviors. Our experimental results are performed on one year of MBO data containing small-tick, medium-tick, and large-tick stocks from NASDAQ. To validate the usefulness of our clustering, we compute order flow imbalances across each cluster within 30-minute buckets during the trading day. We treat each cluster's imbalance as a signal that provides insights into trading strategies and participants' responses to varying market conditions. To assess the effectiveness of these signals, we identify the trading strategy with the highest Sharpe ratio in the training dataset, and demonstrate that its performance in the test dataset is superior to benchmark trading strategies that do not incorporate clustering. We also evaluate trading strategies based on order flow imbalance decompositions across different market event types, including add, cancel, and trade events, to assess their robustness in various market conditions. This work establishes a robust framework for clustering market participant behavior, which helps us to better understand market microstructure, and inform the development of more effective predictive trading signals with practical applications in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance.</details>

The open-source framework incorporates a persistent order book with market and limit orders, partial fills, dividends, and equilibrium clearing alongside agents with varied strategies, information sets, and endowments. Agents submit standardized decisions using structured outputs and function calls while expressing their reasoning in natural language. Three findings emerge: First, LLMs demonstrate consistent strategy adherence and can function as value investors, momentum traders, or market makers per their instructions. Second, market dynamics exhibit features of real financial markets, including price discovery, bubbles, underreaction, and strategic liquidity provision. Third, the framework enables analysis of LLMs' responses to varying market conditions, similar to partial dependence plots in machine-learning interpretability. The framework allows simulating financial theories without closed-form solutions, creating experimental designs that would be costly with human participants, and establishing how prompts can generate correlated behaviors affecting market stability.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Maximizing revenue for grid-scale battery energy storage systems in continuous intraday electricity markets requires strategies that are able to seize trading opportunities as soon as new information arrives. This paper introduces and evaluates an automated high-frequency trading strategy for battery energy storage systems trading on the intraday market for power while explicitly considering the dynamics of the limit order book, market rules, and technical parameters. The standard rolling intrinsic strategy is adapted for continuous intraday electricity markets and solved using a dynamic programming approximation that is two to three orders of magnitude faster than an exact mixed-integer linear programming solution. A detailed backtest over a full year of German order book data demonstrates that the proposed dynamic programming formulation does not reduce trading profits and enables the policy to react to every relevant order book update, enabling realistic rapid backtesting. Our results show the significant revenue potential of high-frequency trading: our policy earns 58% more than when re-optimizing only once every hour and 14% more than when re-optimizing once per minute, highlighting that profits critically depend on trading speed. Furthermore, we leverage the speed of our algorithm to train a parametric extension of the rolling intrinsic, increasing yearly revenue by 8.4% out of sample.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>The paper analyses trade between the most developed economies of the world. The analysis is based on the previously proposed model of international trade. This model of international trade is based on the theory of general economic equilibrium. The demand for goods in this model is built on the import of goods by each of the countries participating in the trade. The structure of supply of goods in this model is determined by the structure of exports of each country. It is proved that in such a model, given a certain structure of supply and demand, there exists a so-called ideal equilibrium state in which the trade balance of each country is zero. Under certain conditions on the structure of supply and demand, there is an equilibrium state in which each country have a strictly positive trade balance. Among the equilibrium states under a certain structure of supply and demand, there are some that differ from the ones described above. Such states are characterized by the fact that there is an inequitable distribution of income between the participants in the trade. Such states are called degenerate. In this paper, based on the previously proposed model of international trade, an analysis of the dynamics of international trade of 8 of the world's most developed economies is made. It is shown that trade between these countries was not in a state of economic equilibrium. The found relative equilibrium price vector turned out to be very degenerate, which indicates the unequal exchange of goods on the market of the 8 studied countries. An analysis of the dynamics of supply to the market of the world's most developed economies showed an increase in China's share. The same applies to the share of demand.</details>

In addition, we allow for stochastic terminal and running targets. Initially, we formulate the optimal trade execution task as a stochastic control problem with a finite-variation control process that acts as an integrator both in the state dynamics and in the cost functional. We then extend this problem continuously to a stochastic control problem with progressively measurable controls. By identifying this extended problem as equivalent to a certain linear-quadratic stochastic control problem, we can use established results in linear-quadratic stochastic control to solve the extended problem. This work generalizes [Ackermann, Kruse, Urusov; FinancStoch'24] from the single-asset setting to the multi-asset case. In particular, we reveal cross-hedging effects, showing that it can be optimal to trade in an asset despite having no initial position.

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We investigate portfolio optimization in financial markets from a trading and risk management perspective. We term this task Risk-Aware Trading Portfolio Optimization (RATPO), formulate the corresponding optimization problem, and propose an efficient Risk-Aware Trading Swarm (RATS) algorithm to solve it. The key elements of RATPO are a generic initial portfolio P, a specific set of Unique Eligible Instruments (UEIs), their combination into an Eligible Optimization Strategy (EOS), an objective function, and a set of constraints. RATS searches for an optimal EOS that, added to P, improves the objective function repecting the constraints.   RATS is a specialized Particle Swarm Optimization method that leverages the parameterization of P in terms of UEIs, enables parallel computation with a large number of particles, and is fully general with respect to specific choices of the key elements, which can be customized to encode financial knowledge and needs of traders and risk managers.   We showcase two RATPO applications involving a real trading portfolio made of hundreds of different financial instruments, an objective function combining both market risk (VaR) and profit&loss measures, constrains on market sensitivities and UEIs trading costs. In the case of small-sized EOS, RATS successfully identifies the optimal solution and demonstrates robustness with respect to hyper-parameters tuning. In the case of large-sized EOS, RATS markedly improves the portfolio objective value, optimizing risk and capital charge while respecting risk limits and preserving expected profits.   Our work bridges the gap between the implementation of effective trading strategies and compliance with stringent regulatory and economic capital requirements, allowing a better alignment of business and risk management objectives.</details>

We consider agents who must absorb flows and manage risk by deciding whether to warehouse it or hedge in the market, thereby incurring transaction costs and market impact. Unlike market makers, these agents cannot skew their quotes to attract offsetting flows and deter risk-increasing ones, leading to a fundamentally different problem. Within the Almgren-Chriss framework, we derive almost-closed-form solutions in the case of quadratic execution costs, while more general cases require numerical methods.

In my previous work arXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated significant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly optimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve predictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully linear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for dynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic neural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time. We introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and second, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously optimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis, conducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this dynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional methods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance gains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across varying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures can effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.</details>


- **Agent Trading Arena: A Study on Numerical Understanding in LLM-Based Agents**
  - Tianmi Ma et al. | [2502.17967v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17967v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language tasks, yet their performance in dynamic, real-world financial environments remains underexplored. Existing approaches are limited to historical backtesting, where trading actions cannot influence market prices and agents train only on static data. To address this limitation, we present the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual zero-sum stock market in which LLM-based agents engage in competitive multi-agent trading and directly impact price dynamics. By simulating realistic bid-ask interactions, our platform enables training in scenarios that closely mirror live markets, thereby narrowing the gap between training and evaluation. Experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with numerical reasoning when given plain-text data, often overfitting to local patterns and recent values. In contrast, chart-based visualizations significantly enhance both numerical reasoning and trading performance. Furthermore, incorporating a reflection module yields additional improvements, especially with visual inputs. Evaluations on NASDAQ and CSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly under high volatility.

  - Zheli Xiong | [2502.17518v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17518v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper presents a comprehensive study on the use of ensemble Reinforcement Learning (RL) models in financial trading strategies, leveraging classifier models to enhance performance. By combining RL algorithms such as A2C, PPO, and SAC with traditional classifiers like Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, we investigate how different classifier groups can be integrated to improve risk-return trade-offs. The study evaluates the effectiveness of various ensemble methods, comparing them with individual RL models across key financial metrics, including Cumulative Returns, Sharpe Ratios (SR), Calmar Ratios, and Maximum Drawdown (MDD). Our results demonstrate that ensemble methods consistently outperform base models in terms of risk-adjusted returns, providing better management of drawdowns and overall stability. However, we identify the sensitivity of ensemble performance to the choice of variance threshold τ, highlighting the importance of dynamic τ adjustment to achieve optimal performance. This study emphasizes the value of combining RL with classifiers for adaptive decision-making, with implications for financial trading, robotics, and other dynamic environments.</details>

  - Ruoyu Guo et al. | [2502.17493v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17493v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Making consistently profitable financial decisions in a continuously evolving and volatile stock market has always been a difficult task. Professionals from different disciplines have developed foundational theories to anticipate price movement and evaluate securities such as the famed Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In recent years, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in asset pricing has been growing. Although the black-box nature of deep learning models lacks interpretability, they have continued to solidify their position in the financial industry. We aim to further enhance AI's potential and utility by introducing a return-weighted loss function that will drive top growth while providing the ML models a limited amount of information. Using only publicly accessible stock data (open/close/high/low, trading volume, sector information) and several technical indicators constructed from them, we propose an efficient daily trading system that detects top growth opportunities. Our best models achieve 61.73\% annual return on daily rebalancing with an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 1.18 over 1340 testing days from 2019 to 2024, and 37.61\% annual return with an annualized Sharpe Ratio of 0.97 over 1360 testing days from 2005 to 2010. The main drivers for success, especially independent of any domain knowledge, are the novel return-weighted loss function, the integration of categorical and continuous data, and the ML model architecture. We also demonstrate the superiority of our novel loss function over traditional loss functions via several performance metrics and statistical evidence.</details>

  - Guojun Xiong et al. | [2502.11433v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11433v3)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on multimodal financial data have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in various financial tasks. However, they often struggle with multi-step, goal-oriented scenarios in interactive financial markets, such as trading, where complex agentic approaches are required to improve decision-making. To address this, we propose \textsc{FLAG-Trader}, a unified architecture integrating linguistic processing (via LLMs) with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization, in which a partially fine-tuned LLM acts as the policy network, leveraging pre-trained knowledge while adapting to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Through policy gradient optimization driven by trading rewards, our framework not only enhances LLM performance in trading but also improves results on other financial-domain tasks. We present extensive empirical evidence to validate these enhancements.</details>


- **HedgeAgents: A Balanced-aware Multi-agent Financial Trading System**
  - Xiangyu Li et al. | [2502.13165v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13165v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>As automated trading gains traction in the financial market, algorithmic investment strategies are increasingly prominent. While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agent-based models exhibit promising potential in real-time market analysis and trading decisions, they still experience a significant -20% loss when confronted with rapid declines or frequent fluctuations, impeding their practical application. Hence, there is an imperative to explore a more robust and resilient framework. This paper introduces an innovative multi-agent system, HedgeAgents, aimed at bolstering system robustness via ``hedging'' strategies. In this well-balanced system, an array of hedging agents has been tailored, where HedgeAgents consist of a central fund manager and multiple hedging experts specializing in various financial asset classes. These agents leverage LLMs' cognitive capabilities to make decisions and coordinate through three types of conferences. Benefiting from the powerful understanding of LLMs, our HedgeAgents attained a 70% annualized return and a 400% total return over a period of 3 years. Moreover, we have observed with delight that HedgeAgents can even formulate investment experience comparable to those of human experts (https://hedgeagents.github.io/).</details>

  - Chutian Ma et al. | [2502.04284v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04284v1)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We consider the multi-period portfolio optimization problem with a single asset that can be held long or short. Due to the presence of transaction costs, maximizing the immediate reward at each period may prove detrimental, as frequent trading results in consistent negative cash outflows. To simulate alpha decay, we consider a case where not only the present value of a signal, but also past values, have predictive power. We formulate the problem as an infinite horizon Markov Decision Process and seek to characterize the optimal policy that realizes the maximum average expected reward. We propose a variant of the standard value iteration algorithm for computing the optimal policy. Establishing convergence in our setting is nontrivial, and we provide a rigorous proof. Addtionally, we compute a first-order approximation and asymptotics of the optimal policy with small transaction costs.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This study investigates the inherently random structures of dry bulk shipping networks, often likened to a taxi service, and identifies the underlying trade dynamics that contribute to this randomness within individual cargo sub-networks. By analysing micro-level trade flow data from 2015 to 2023, we explore the evolution of dry commodity networks, including grain, coal, and iron ore, and suggest that the Giant Strongly Connected Components exhibit small-world phenomena, indicative of efficient bilateral trade. The significant heterogeneity of in-degree and out-degree within these sub-networks, primarily driven by importing ports, underscores the complexity of their dynamics. Our temporal analysis shows that while the Covid-19 pandemic profoundly impacted the coal network, the Ukraine conflict significantly altered the grain network, resulting in changes in community structures. Notably, grain sub-networks display periodic changes, suggesting distinct life cycles absent in coal and iron ore networks. These findings illustrate that the randomness in dry bulk shipping networks is a reflection of real-world trade dynamics, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in navigating and predicting network behaviours.</details>

  - Leonardo Berti et al. | [2502.07071v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07071v3)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Financial markets are complex systems characterized by high statistical noise, nonlinearity, volatility, and constant evolution. Thus, modeling them is extremely hard. Here, we address the task of generating realistic and responsive Limit Order Book (LOB) market simulations, which are fundamental for calibrating and testing trading strategies, performing market impact experiments, and generating synthetic market data. We propose a novel TRAnsformer-based Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Engine for LOB Simulations (TRADES). TRADES generates realistic order flows as time series conditioned on the state of the market, leveraging a transformer-based architecture that captures the temporal and spatial characteristics of high-frequency market data. There is a notable absence of quantitative metrics for evaluating generative market simulation models in the literature. To tackle this problem, we adapt the predictive score, a metric measured as an MAE, to market data by training a stock price predictive model on synthetic data and testing it on real data. We compare TRADES with previous works on two stocks, reporting a 3.27 and 3.48 improvement over SoTA according to the predictive score, demonstrating that we generate useful synthetic market data for financial downstream tasks. Furthermore, we assess TRADES's market simulation realism and responsiveness, showing that it effectively learns the conditional data distribution and successfully reacts to an experimental agent, giving sprout to possible calibrations and evaluations of trading strategies and market impact experiments. To perform the experiments, we developed DeepMarket, the first open-source Python framework for LOB market simulation with deep learning. In our repository, we include a synthetic LOB dataset composed of TRADES's generated simulations.</details>

  - Kuan-Ming Liu et al. | [2501.09636v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09636v2)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Recent advances in deep learning and large language models (LLMs) have facilitated the deployment of the mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism in the stock investment domain. While these models have demonstrated promising trading performance, they are often unimodal, neglecting the wealth of information available in other modalities, such as textual data. Moreover, the traditional neural network-based router selection mechanism fails to consider contextual and real-world nuances, resulting in suboptimal expert selection. To address these limitations, we propose LLMoE, a novel framework that employs LLMs as the router within the MoE architecture. Specifically, we replace the conventional neural network-based router with LLMs, leveraging their extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities to select experts based on historical price data and stock news. This approach provides a more effective and interpretable selection mechanism. Our experiments on multimodal real-world stock datasets demonstrate that LLMoE outperforms state-of-the-art MoE models and other deep neural network approaches. Additionally, the flexible architecture of LLMoE allows for easy adaptation to various downstream tasks.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We study strategic interactions in a broker-mediated market. A broker provides liquidity to an informed trader and to noise traders while managing inventory in the lit market. The broker and the informed trader maximise their trading performance while filtering each other's private information; the trader estimates the broker's trading activity in the lit market while the broker estimates the informed trader's private signal. Brokers hold a strategic advantage over traders who rely solely on prices to filter information. We find that information leakage in the client's trading flow yields an economic value to the broker that is comparable to transaction costs; she speculates profitably and mitigates risk effectively, which, in turn, adversely impacts the informed trader's performance. In contrast, low signal-to-noise sources, such as prices, result in the broker's trading performance being indistinguishable from that of a naive strategy that internalises noise flow, externalises informed flow, and offloads inventory at a constant rate.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Significant progress has been made in automated problem-solving using societies of agents powered by large language models (LLMs). In finance, efforts have largely focused on single-agent systems handling specific tasks or multi-agent frameworks independently gathering data. However, the multi-agent systems' potential to replicate real-world trading firms' collaborative dynamics remains underexplored. TradingAgents proposes a novel stock trading framework inspired by trading firms, featuring LLM-powered agents in specialized roles such as fundamental analysts, sentiment analysts, technical analysts, and traders with varied risk profiles. The framework includes Bull and Bear researcher agents assessing market conditions, a risk management team monitoring exposure, and traders synthesizing insights from debates and historical data to make informed decisions. By simulating a dynamic, collaborative trading environment, this framework aims to improve trading performance. Detailed architecture and extensive experiments reveal its superiority over baseline models, with notable improvements in cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown, highlighting the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks in financial trading.

We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs, including BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The study documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent daily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the highest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly ahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1% accuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model scores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in different model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive relevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant relationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock returns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current financial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels with a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT long-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary yield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior performance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction and portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of financial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy analysis.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>This paper leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast and analyze financial time series. The process begins with a denoising autoencoder to filter out random noise fluctuations from the main contract price data. Then, one-dimensional convolution reduces the dimensionality of the filtered data and extracts key information. The filtered and dimensionality-reduced price data is fed into a GANs network, and its output serve as input of a fully connected network. Through cross-validation, a model is trained to capture features that precede large price fluctuations. The model predicts the likelihood and direction of significant price changes in real-time price sequences, placing trades at moments of high prediction accuracy. Empirical results demonstrate that using autoencoders and convolution to filter and denoise financial data, combined with GANs, achieves a certain level of predictive performance, validating the capabilities of machine learning algorithms to discover underlying patterns in financial sequences.

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>We introduce a model for limit order book of a certain security with two main features: First, both the limit orders and market orders for the given asset are allowed to appear and interact with each other. Second, the high frequency trading activities are allowed and described by the scaling limit of nearly-unstable multi-dimensional Hawkes processes with power law decay. The model has been derived as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE, for short), under certain intuitive identifications. Its diffusion coefficient is determined by a Volterra integral equation driven by a Hawkes process, whose Hurst exponent is less than 1/2 (so that the relevant process is negatively correlated). As a result, the volatility path of the SPDE is rougher than that driven by a (standard) Brownian motion. The well-posedness follows from a result in literature. Hence, a foundation is laid down for further studies in this direction.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Because of the theoretical challenges posed by the Efficient Market Hypothesis to technical analysis, the effectiveness of technical indicators in high-frequency trading remains inadequately explored, particularly at the minute-level frequency, where effects of the microstructure of the market dominate. This study evaluates the integration of traditional technical indicators with random forest regression models using minute-level SPY data, analyzing 13 distinct model configurations. Our empirical results reveal a stark contrast between in-sample and out-of-sample performance, with $R^2$ values deteriorating from 0.749--0.812 during training to negative values in testing. A feature importance analysis demonstrates that primary price-based features dominate the predictions made by the model, accounting for over 60% of the importance, while established technical indicators, such as RSI and Bollinger Bands, account for only 14%--15%. Although the indicator-enhanced models achieved superior risk-adjusted metrics, with Rachev ratios between 0.919 and 0.961, they consistently underperformed a simple buy-and-hold strategy, generating returns ranging from -2.4% to -3.9%. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about the usefulness of technical indicators in algorithmic trading, suggesting that in high-frequency contexts, they may be more relevant to risk management rather than to predicting returns. For practitioners and researchers, our findings indicate that successful high-frequency trading strategies should focus on adaptive feature selection and regime-specific modeling rather than relying on traditional technical indicators, as well as indicating the critical importance of robust out-of-sample testing in the development of a model.</details>

We performed a replication of the methodology of Guijarro-Ordonez et al.

Adhering strictly to point-in-time (PIT) principles and ensuring no information leakage, we follow the same data pre-processing, factor modeling, and deep learning architectures (CNNs and Transformers) as outlined by G-P-Z. Our replication yields unusually strong performance metrics in certain tests, with out-of-sample Sharpe ratios occasionally exceeding 10. While such results are intriguing, they may indicate model overfitting, highly specific market conditions, or insufficient accounting for transaction costs and market impact. Further examination and robustness checks are needed to align these findings with the more modest improvements reported in the original study.

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>Leveraged Exchange Traded Funds (LETFs), while extremely controversial in the literature, remain stubbornly popular with both institutional and retail investors in practice. While the criticisms of LETFs are certainly valid, we argue that their potential has been underestimated in the literature due to the use of very simple investment strategies involving LETFs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the potential of including a broad stock market index LETF in long-term, dynamically-optimal investment strategies designed to maximize the outperformance over standard investment benchmarks in the sense of the information ratio (IR). Our results exploit the observation that positions in a LETF deliver call-like payoffs, so that the addition of a LETF to a portfolio can be a convenient way to add inexpensive leverage while providing downside protection. Under stylized assumptions, we present and analyze closed-form IR-optimal investment strategies using either a LETF or standard/vanilla ETF (VETF) on the same equity index, which provides the necessary intuition for the potential and benefits of LETFs. In more realistic settings, we use a neural network-based approach to determine the IR-optimal strategies, trained on bootstrapped historical data. We find that IR-optimal strategies with a broad stock market LETF are not only more likely to outperform the benchmark than IR-optimal strategies derived using the corresponding VETF, but are able to achieve partial stochastic dominance over the benchmark and VETF-based strategies in terms of terminal wealth.</details>

  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary>High-frequency trading (HFT) represents a pivotal and intensely competitive domain within the financial markets. The velocity and accuracy of data processing exert a direct influence on profitability, underscoring the significance of this field. The objective of this work is to optimise the real-time processing of data in high-frequency trading algorithms. The dynamic feature selection mechanism is responsible for monitoring and analysing market data in real time through clustering and feature weight analysis, with the objective of automatically selecting the most relevant features. This process employs an adaptive feature extraction method, which enables the system to respond and adjust its feature set in a timely manner when the data input changes, thus ensuring the efficient utilisation of data. The lightweight neural networks are designed in a modular fashion, comprising fast convolutional layers and pruning techniques that facilitate the expeditious completion of data processing and output prediction. In contrast to conventional deep learning models, the neural network architecture has been specifically designed to minimise the number of parameters and computational complexity, thereby markedly reducing the inference time. The experimental results demonstrate that the model is capable of maintaining consistent performance in the context of varying market conditions, thereby illustrating its advantages in terms of processing speed and revenue enhancement.</details>
